<h1>Dark Mode</h1>
<p class="excerpt">Dark mode is one of the most in-demand features of 2019, and for good reason. By inverting the colours on your screen, you can put less strain on your eyes, improve the readability of text and even save battery if your handset has an OLED display.</p>
<p>In the earliest days of home computing, the much-hyped feature we now call “dark mode” was the default. Cathode ray tube (CRT) monitors, also known as monochrome monitors, got their Matrix-esque green-on-black look from the phosphor-coated inside of the screens.</p>
<p>It’s been a long time since manufacturers stopped painting monitors with phosphor, but some people still swear by dark themes for everything. The Verge keeps a running list of apps and platforms that offer a dark mode for fans, and Apple announced a dark mode feature for iOS 13 at the company's annual WWDC conference this week.</p>
